## Usage

First, install the package with `pip install typesplainer`

Then like any other tool such a `black`, `isort`. run typesplainer on your desired files or directory. It will automatically find all types and then explain them for you. e.g.

```sh
python -m typesplainer my_file.py
python -m typesplainer my_directory
```

### Features

- Very performant! Takes 1.7 seconds (YMMV) to explain the entire [python rich library source code](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) consisting of around 50,000 lines!
- Colorized output. Output with colors is going to make sure your eyes feel refreshed.
- Intelligent explanation. Takes pluralization, pronoun usage, article usage, correct grammar into account.
- Best in class parser. It does not rely on some substandard AI based description generator, instead it parses the file using [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)'s custom parser and shows the most accurate description
